%The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
%The next section presents the state of the art and related works, and comments their differences with regard to this study, along with its contribution to advance in this research line. TORCS simulator is described in Section \ref{sec:torcs}.
%The proposed fuzzy controller (and its sub-controllers) is detailed in Section \ref{sec:fuzzy_controller}, whereas it is tested in `real' (simulated) races in Section \ref{sec:results}. Obtained results are analyzed and compared 
%with other controllers are given in the same section. Finally, the conclusions and future lines of work are included in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.
