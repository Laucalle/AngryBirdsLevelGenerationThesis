\subsection{Open Source Simulator}

The fitness evaluation requires a simulation to test the behaviour of the levels under the game's physics. Angry Birds is not open source software and so the code is not available; therefore, a game clone was developed to fill this gap, using the Unity Engine.

Levels are described in XML files which the game takes as an input. They are parsed to run the simulation which then generates new XML files as an output. Those files contain information about the execution of a certain level such as average velocity of each element, the amount of collisions and the final rotation.
