\section{The necessity of Procedural Content Generation}
Computer games are a relatively new form of media whose popularity has been increasing non-stop since they appeared in the 70s. Many challenges have arisen---and will keep doing so---throughout the evolution of the industry, from the early arcades to the most complex modern open-world video games. Developers have come up with all sorts of creative ways to overcome hardware limitations, delivering better graphics and audio. They have pushed the boundaries of the medium by finding new forms of interaction and engaging players with compelling storytelling and original game mechanics. Many of them are related to the fast pace at which the game industry is growing, reaching every passing year to broader audiences that demand a wider range of experiences. Crafting them requires great effort and a high consumption of resources. How do we create a vast amount of content that suits players expectations with lower investment? The answer can be replayability, adaptative content or reduction of designers' workload. All of which can be tackled using \acf{PCG}.\cite{togelius2016introduction}

Replayability, also referred to as replay value, relies on how interesting playing a game more than once is. It is easy to understand why it would be a desirable feature for both players and developers: from the player's point of view, they can extend the game experience further---past the credits roll. For designers, replay value means their product offers more with less manually crafted content.

Games can also engage players by adapting gameplay elements to each individual player. In a literal sense, this would be impracticable. Instead, users are usually presented with options to adjust to their preferred style. What is more interesting, the game itself can change based on in-game player behaviour. It can regulate its difficulty level to fit the player's learning curve or create content that matches the player's taste.

Both applications above use \ac{PCG} as a replacement for human designers. However, \ac{PCG} can be used as a tool to assist developers. It can suggest what might be a base for later development, enhancing human creativity rather than displacing it. 

\section{What is Procedural Content Generation}
The definition of \acf{PCG} has been broadly discussed but there is no agreement. We have plenty of examples of what \textit{is} and what \textit{is not} \ac{PCG}, but every definition struggles to cover all cases, either being too inclusive or too exclusive. The one we choose here balances well between the two, defining \ac{PCG} as \textit{the algorithmical creation of game content with limited or indirect user input} \cite{togelius2011procedural}.

Although \ac{PCG} often uses AI techniques, this definition does not include all uses of AI in games. We do not consider \acs{NPC} behaviour or AI playing agents as content, thus they are not \ac{PCG} either. Aesthetic elements, game rules, levels, items, stories and characters among others are considered content in this definition.

Note that neither computers nor video games are mentioned in the definition. In fact, \ac{PCG} has its roots in analogical games. This may conflict with the \textit{limited or indirect user input}, but it is reasonable to assume that following a detailed set of instructions---even if it is done by a human---is not \textit{input}. The underlying concepts used much earlier by non-digital games still prevail in modern video games. Using an algorithm to assemble pre-designed pieces is a common technique in tabletop roleplaying guides---where the algorithm usually consists in several dice rolls---such as \textit{Dungeon \& Dragons}. It is not surprising that one of the early adaptations of \ac{PCG} to digital platforms aimed to generate monsters and dungeons for physical games.\cite{smith2015analog}

\subsection{Taxonomy}
There are many \ac{PCG} methods and it is necessary to look at some traits that characterize and differentiate them from each other: \cite{togelius2016introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Online/offline}: In online generation, the \ac{PCG} occurs during the game session, while the user is playing the game. If it is done before the game session or during development, we have offline generation. 
	\item \textit{Necessary/optional}: Procedurally generated content may be part of the essential structure of the game or can be additional to the game experience and can be discarded. In the first one the content is \textit{necessary} and needs to be correct while the latter is \textit{optional}.
	\item \textit{Degree and dimensions of control}: As any other algorithm, a \ac{PCG} method can have a number of parameters which affect the output. If it uses random numbers, the seed is one of them.
	\item \textit{Generic/adaptative}: Adaptative generation takes into account player behaviour while generic does not. Although there are exceptions, most commercial games choose generic over adaptative.
	\item \textit{Stochastic/deterministic}: Deterministic \ac{PCG} will produce the same output given the same input, in contrast to stochastic generation which is not as easy to replicate. 
	\item \textit{Constructive/generate-and-test}: Generate-and-test produces potentially correct solutions that are tested and adjusted in each iteration before giving the actual output. Constructive methods build partial solutions and add on them.
	\item \textit{Automatic/mixed authorship}: \ac{PCG} can be used as an assisting tool for designers, whether the output is used as a base or as an interactive process. Then we talk about mixed authorship, as opposed to the automatic generation where the designer does not take part. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Search-based Procedural Content Generation}

A special kind of \textit{generate-and-test} approach to \ac{PCG} is \acf{SBPCG}, which is usually---but not always---tackled with Evolutionary Algorithms. The problems faced by \ac{SBPCG} are not very far from those encountered in Evolutionary problems. 

The test function does not determine if a solution is valid, but it grades how good the solution is. This is often called \textit{fitness function}. In \ac{SBPCG}, how to evaluate the quality of a solution has no straightforward answer. It requires formalizing what is fun, exciting or engaging content as a \textit{fitness function}, which are usually based in tricky assumptions.

There are three main classes of \textit{fitness functions} in \ac{SBPCG}\cite{togelius2010search}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Direct Fitness Function} where certain features are extracted from the generated content and directly mapped to a fitness value. Those features must be easily measurable.
	\item \textit{Simulation-Based Fitness Function} where an agent plays throw some part of the game that involves the generated content. The fitness is calculated using features from the agent's gameplay. 
	\item \textit{Interactive Fitness Function} where the fitness value is obtained from the player, whether it be explicitly by asking them or implicitly by measuring certain responses to the game. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Evolutionary Algorithms}\label{s:EAoverview}

Evolutionary algorithms are optimization methods inspired by biological evolution. They simulate the optimization carried out by nature with genetic inheritance and natural selection, even borrowing the vocabulary from genetics. The following components are necessary to apply an evolutionary algorithm to an specific problem:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A genetic representation of potential solutions, which are \textit{individual} or \textit{chromosome}. Those are formed by smaller units called \textit{features} or \textit{genes} that represents a certain character of the solution.
	\item An initialization method for the population of individuals.
	\item A \textit{fitness function}, which evaluates each individual and gives it a \textit{fitness value}. It plays the role of the environment, determining how likely an individual will survive.
	\item Genetic operators, such as crossover, mutation, selection and replacement.
	\item Values for all its parameters, i.e. population size, probabilities of applying certain operators, number of generations, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Genetic operators}
	\subsubsection{Crossover}
		This operator takes two individuals and produces an offspring, one or more individuals who inherit certain traits from their parents. It is also known as \textit{recombination}. The genes of both parents are combined resulting in new individuals, hopefully with better fitness. However, that is not always the case and some of those new solutions can be infeasible. Recombination is equivalent to sexual reproduction in biological evolution.  
	\subsubsection{Mutation}
		While the rest of the operators focus on exploitation of promising solutions, mutation---along with initialization---usually generates diversity. This is key for escaping local optima and balancing between exploration and exploitation. It is applied after crossover and modifies with a certain probability some genes of the offspring.
	\subsubsection{Selection}
		Selection operator determines which individuals of a given generation will mate and produce offspring. It is usually based in the fitness value of the individuals: better solutions are more likely to breed than others. The output of selection operator is the input for crossover.
	\subsubsection{Replacement}
		In nature, better fit individuals are more likely to survive. In evolutionary algorithms, the replacement operator decides which individuals make it to the next generation. In some strategies, offspring completely replace the previous generation, while others maintain the best individuals through several generations.
