\chapter*{Abstract}
The goal of this project is building stable structures under gravity for the physics based puzzle game Angry Birds. A search-based procedural level generation method was developed using evolutionary algorithms. Different representations and operators were considered and studied. To evaluate the stability of the levels, they are executed in an adaptation of an open source version of the game. An evolutionary framework was implemented to fit the requirements of the problem. To test the method, four experiments were carried out, obtaining a variety of stable structures.
